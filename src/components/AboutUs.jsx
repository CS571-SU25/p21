            Summit Sports Club began as a dream shared by two brothers who wanted to create a
            welcoming space where sports enthusiasts of all ages could come together, train hard,
            and build lasting friendships.

              <p>
                Growing up, the brothers‚ÄîJonathan and Vish (now deceased)‚Äîspent countless hours on their neighborhood
                courts, bonding over friendly matches and a shared love for competition. They quickly
                realized that sports were more than just games; they were a powerful way to foster
                community, promote healthy lifestyles, and encourage personal growth.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fueled by that passion, they pooled their savings, rallied local supporters, and in
                2015 opened the doors to Summit Sports Club. What started with a single tennis court
                has blossomed into a vibrant facility featuring tennis, badminton, weight lifting, and
                the rapidly growing sport of pickleball. Today, Summit Sports Club stands as a hub for
                athletes and beginners alike, united by a shared commitment to camaraderie, wellness,
                and continuous improvement.
